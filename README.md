## Features
The project follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) paradigm for a structured organization:
- controllers/: Contains route handlers and business logic.
- models/: Defines Sequelize models and schema.
- views/: Handlebars.js templates for the UI.
- public/: Static assets (CSS, images, etc.).
- routes/: Express.js route definitions.
- config/: Configuration files.
- middlewares/: Custom middleware functions.
- db/: Database-related files (migrations, seeders).
 
Environment Variables - Sensitive information, including API keys and database credentials, are stored as environment variables for security. 
We set up the files in the root directory with the following variables:
- DB_HOST=your-database-host
- DB_USER=your-database-username
- DB_PASS=your-database-password
- SESSION_SECRET=your-session-secret
